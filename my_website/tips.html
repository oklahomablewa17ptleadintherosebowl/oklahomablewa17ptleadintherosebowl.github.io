    <h2>Tip #1: Always double check your code for mistakes</h2>
    <tt>When typing lots of code, it is very easy for you to make a mistake. Because of this, you should always make sure to check your code as much as possible in order to eliminate any chance of these mistakes plaguing your project.</tt>
    <br>
    <h2>Tip #2:Make sure to save as much as possible</h2>
    <tt>When coding, it is important to save your project as much as possible. It is very easy to make major mistakes or delete something, and in many programs, it is hard to recover what you have deleted. If you are constantly saving your project, you will have a more sturdy backup file and if you accidentally delete something, you won't have to redo as much work as you would have.</tt>
    <br>
    <h2>Tip #3:Utilize any available resources</h2>
    <tt>Coding, especially when you are new to it, can be a very daunting task. Because of this, you should be sure to make use of any resources that could help you in your task. For example, if you are new to coding in CSS, you could access the CSS cheat sheet so you know some of the shortcuts and commands.</tt>
